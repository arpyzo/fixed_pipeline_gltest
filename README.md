# Fixed pipeline OpenGL test

Demo application written to learn and experiment with fixed pipeline OpenGL features.

## Warning!

This code is undergoing a major refactoring and will almost certainly give you a headache in its current state.

## Demos

 * State retrieval
 * 2D points, lines, and vertices
 * 3D shapes with rotation
 * Lighting effects
 * Blending

## TODO

 * Reformatting
 * Refactoring
 * Memory leaks need fixing

## OUTDATED

Outdated as it uses a fixed pipeline which have been superseded by programmable pipelines.
