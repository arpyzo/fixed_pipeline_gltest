# Fixed pipeline OpenGL test

Demo application written to learn and experiment with fixed pipeline OpenGL features.

## Requirements

This demo makes use of wxWidgets to provide basic GUI features including an OpenGL context. GLUT is used to provide access to OpenGL functions.

## Refactoring

This code has undergone a major refactoring and repair. The camera and vector functions have been cleaned up a little, but could use further refactoring.

## Demos

 * State retrieval
 * 2D points, lines, and vertices
 * 3D shapes with rotation
 * Lighting effects
 * Blending

## OUTDATED

Outdated as it uses a fixed pipeline which have been superseded by programmable pipelines.
