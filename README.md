# Fixed pipeline OpenGL test

Demo application written to learn and experiment with OpenGL features.

## Demos

 * State retrieval
 * 2D points, lines, and vertices
 * 3D shapes with rotation
 * Lighting effects
 * Blending

## TODO

 * Major reformatting
 * Refactoring
 * Memory leaks need fixing

## OUTDATED

Outdated as it uses a fixed pipeline which has been superseded by programmable pipelines.
